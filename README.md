A silly Mac app inspired by Schr√∂dinger's cat. When you drag files on to the application it will create a password protected and encrypted disk image the size of your files. It will then either copy your files to the disk image or create a readme text file that says "The cat is dead."

Here is a video demonstration of the app:

Made with macOS Automator, and generous help from ChatGPT.
