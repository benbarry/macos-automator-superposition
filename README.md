# About Superposition

Superposition is silly Mac app inspired by [Schr√∂dinger's cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat). When you drag files on to the application it will create a password protected disk image the approximate size of your files. It will then either copy your files to the disk image or create an otherwise empty disk image with a readme text file that just says "The cat is dead."

Here is a video demonstration of the app:

This app was made with macOS Automator, and generous help from ChatGPT.

# Usage

Files should first be placed in a single folder, and then that folder should be dragged on the Superposition app icon. This is due to [this issue with Automator](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250641659).
